\section*{Problem 1}
\lipsum[1]
By the way, I found that the global minimum is got with $W = [3.2613, 26.7420]$. 
But by using SGD, the solution I got was usually $W = [4.7+, 0.4+]$.
As the function is so simple(linear), I thought it shouldn't stuck in a local minimum. But starting
with (0,0), it did. I don't know why this happened.
